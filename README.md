# ðŸ“¦ Recall

## Why

I usually need to search up older commands in the correct order they were executed. Using the classic `history` command this is tedious and we cant group by session or search through the commands easily. In certain automation tasks it really helps to have `recall` inbuilt.

Recall is a modern, extensible alternative to the classic `history` command. It provides advanced command history management, session tracking, and a terminal user interface for searching and exploring your shell command history.

## Features

- **Command Logging**: Automatically logs every command you run in your shell (supports Bash, Zsh, and Fish).
- **Session Tracking**: Groups commands by terminal session for better context.
- **TUI Viewer**: Browse, search, and filter your command history in a terminal user interface.
- **Shell Integration**: Easy setup for Bash, Zsh, and Fish shells.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux and other Unix-like systems.
